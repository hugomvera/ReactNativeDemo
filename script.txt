 this is the script on react native list



introdcution. supppose that we wanted to add a set numnber of items in the app. 


lets say that we put in  a number and then when it hits enter it creates an n number of rows or items. 

lets first add a input field to our button on the right of the button if all goes well 

in order to do that we need to have this tag in 

  <TextInput
      style={styles.input}
      onChangeText={onChangeText}
      value={text}
    />

we also need a hook for the text i talked about this on my provous video link in the descripton 


const [text, onChangueText] = useState('Useless Text');


this will keep track of the text variable and weheter you want to call on change text everytime it changes. however we will tie it to the button press. 

it might be probalmatic or a little trigger happy if everythime a leteter changes then it would be the case that that function is called


let go ahead and add it now to the code ,  i will make thigs easier for me and place the code right afdter the button code. 

action place the code righ after the buttoon 


we also need to add the use state variables and the set fucntion 

we add it right after the oter use state vairbales and set function 

action do that

lastley  we need to import thigs here 


we need to import TextInput from react native 

action   do it


how that we got all that working  lets change it so isnteaead of putting a hjnumber of the times the button has pressed now we can change that text to whatever is the inpout 

leave it as a question to them and also ask what do you think will happen . 



in the prevous paradigmsi the text would not update unless the button was pressed and that was tied to that proecess but in aour case because we use reacteive lements we get that the text chjanges key by key 



now that we know the text is cahnging let us make it so everytime we hit that button to progress we need it to show in . wo when we hit enter a new item is created. 

 inorder to do that we need to use flat list


 the reaslon to use a flatlist is that it is a lirbary from react native that it is for displayuing  many items like an array of thigs as input and the output is the rows of items in our case. 

 we will make a array of things to do  or some data scruttreu..  


 anyways let us look in the flatlist Documentation 


we will need to create an array  I will assume your are familiar with arrays and stacks and quues. if not its fine 

probalby the hardest thing to wrap aroudn that the data needs to be in a maping it needs a unique id and a some data associated it with it like text


the Data needs to be in the form of 

key mapping form 
where the there is a key like 

1 -> "todo 1"
2 -> "todo 2"
.
.
.
n -> "todo n"


in javascript it needs to be of the form 


const Data  = [
{
id:1,
title:"First Todo"
  },
{id:2,
title:"second Todo"

  },
{id:3,
title:"Third Todo"},


]

now we can look at the tag for the flat list 
 it will need 3 things the data obvouly that is data, a way to get the key from the data that is the id and lastly the items that need to be renbder 


 data will be like 

 data ={Data}


 the key extractor will look like 

 keyExtractore  = {item => item.id}

 it stablises a correalation between the item and and id


 lastly how the items will be rendered

 in our case 

 renderItem={({item}) => <Text> {item.title} <Text/>}


when we put it all togheter it should be like this 


<FlatList
data = {DATA}
renderItem = {({item}) => <Text> {item.title} <Text/>  }
keyExtractor={item => item.id}
/>


we need to place the data at the very top afdter the imports

and also we need the flat list the last thing before the view ends

do not forget to put in the import for the flast list under react nmative 

  and there we have the list so far 

  the thing that was in memrory it is alreayd reneder and we want to may be now if we tipe it in the input box then to put into the data and add things .

firs we need to improt the FlatList library
